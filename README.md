# smashnet-nro
NOTICE: THIS IS DEPRECATED. The main `smashnet` crate has been refactored to not require curl-sys, and therefore use of smashnet does not require devkitpro or a smashnet.nro to be built or function. Please do not use this repository.

The nro for smashnet, a smash ultimate networking plugin.

This plugin exports networking functionality such as exposing smash ultimate's statically linked libcurl in a way that makes them usable to plugins. Use https://github.com/techyCoder81/smashnet as your dependency if you wish to call this functionality.
